I had a need to keep track of my sales and print impressive, stylish Estimates and Invoices so I created this pdf software for my own business so for a low price you can use it too! You can accomplish all of the tasks listed below with this All-In-One simple but very effective Estimate and Invoicing System optimized to save you time! This Product is Invoice/Estimate Software For Both Sales and Service Businesses. It's easy to use and you can't beat the price. Amounts Auto-Calculate on a Fillable Adobe PDF document with editable text. All you have to do is enter the labor times & Items etc... It comes with a text heading and a upload Logo image button for a more custom look. QuickBooks can be overwhelming and simply overkill for many small businesses that have a bookkeeper anyway. Use this software to generate a spreadsheet that will have all the data you need on it at tax time!

19) An Invoice can be used as an Estimate then converted back into an invoice so that you do not have to retype every line item.
20) The "Other" field that appears in the totals summary is editable. For example the word "Other" could say "Shipping" then in the amount field you could pass on the cost of shipping. As another example word "Other" could say "Discount" then in the amount field you could pass on a discount amount such as -10.00.
21) The "Service Fee" field that appears in the totals summary is editable. For example the words "Service Fee" could say "Discount" then in the amount field you could pass on a discount amount such as %-10.000 subtracting 10% from the Grand Total.
22) If parts of the invoice disappear just zoom in or out as the page just needs a refresh.
23) Choose a predefined color scheme from a drop down list. If some or all of the colors are inappropriate, enter new hex color codes in the color fields provided until the color scheme is customized to your needs.
24) Google "Hex Color" for more Info
25) This template has an option to save each form as a suggested file name. The auto generated suggested file name is a comma separated list of "Title, Date, Customer, Form No., Labor, Goods, Other, Sales Tax, Subtotal, % Amt, Total, Paid/Unpaid, Notes". Each file name can then be copy pasted into a spreadsheet daily. Also at the end of the quarter or year all of the invoice totals can be imported into a spreadsheet and added together with very little effort using the script provided.
